- 👋 Hi, I’m @AaronAragon156
- 👀 I’m interested in ...R/C race cars and trucks. My step dad is a three time world champion and he is mentoring me and helping me. I'm truly grateful for all of my family and friends today for everything that they have done and continue to do for me.  I currently work at a grocery store called Harris Teeter. I am a dairy and frozen food clerk and I love it! I'm going to further my career and be a manager for them one day that's my long term goal for my future.  I have two grown kids aged 20 and 18 years old and I love them very much. They live with their mom in a different city in NC where I call home.  Thank you for allowing me to participate in this exciting project and I look forward to working with you all soon. Thank you again and please feel free to contact me if you can.
